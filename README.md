# soccer_player_price_prediction
Repository for a non-github project to predict market value of soccer players


## Project Overview

The trade of football players between clubs involve huge sums of money. Therefore, the problem at hand is a misevaluation of a playerâ€™s worth, that can result in huge financial losses for the clubs. The main objective of the project is therefore to use a suitable machine learning algorithm and come up with a model that can predict the market value of football players with maximum accuracy. Apart from predicting the market value, the project will also attempt to analyse and find out which features significantly determine the value of a footballer. 

The project involves usage of various game related as well as real life statistics of  4705 players across the top 10 soccer leagues across the world. The attributes cover the attacking and defending skillsets of a player as per the game EA FIFA 20 along with certain real-life performance metrics in the 2018-2019 season. (Please note that the stats provided to the player in the FIFA 20 game are based on the performance in the 2018-2019 season). Further the project focuses only on outfield players, meaning players playing in all positions except goalkeepers. This is because goalkeepers have a completely different set of attributes and cannot be directly compared with outfield players).
